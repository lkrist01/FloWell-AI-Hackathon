# FloWell-AI-Hackathon

Team name: FloWell 

Title of problem
Summarise patient resource needs (whatâ€™s needed next) from ALL EHR data into a brief overview via a timeline

Description:

Flowell, a streamlined discharge navigator project, aims to enhance integrated care and  discharge processes by summarising information from patient notes into an accurate timeline of events, and identifying necessary patient resources from EHR data. This system addresses challenges identified with synthesising large volumes of data entries from various professionals, improves resource allocation, enhances communication between healthcare staff, understands reasons for discharge blockages and ultimately provides actionable information to streamline and prioritise delivery of care and discharge processes for better patient outcomes and hospital efficiency.

Benefits:
Time-saving for clinical staff reading through large volume of entries
Reduced clinical error: providing up-to-date information and progress of patients
Improved communication between staffs
Cost-effective minimising repeated visits/ procedures/ imaging

Technical Components and Requirements:
EHR configuration, patient note examples
