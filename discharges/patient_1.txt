                    You were admitted to the hospital with severe chest pain radiating to your left arm. This indicated a possible heart attack (myocardial infarction).
                    Upon arrival, an EKG was performed, which showed signs of a heart attack. Blood tests confirmed this diagnosis. A cardiologist recommended an urgent procedure called a coronary angioplasty with stent placement to open up a blocked artery.
                    The procedure was successful in opening the blocked artery in your left anterior descending artery (LAD) and placing a stent. You recovered well from the procedure, and your pain was managed with medication.
                    During your stay, you received physical therapy, occupational therapy, and education from a dietician to help you recover and regain your strength. You also had an echocardiogram, which showed good left ventricular function with minimal wall motion abnormality.
                    You were discharged home on May 27th with medication and a follow-up appointment scheduled. You were also given instructions for a home exercise program and advice on lifestyle changes to maintain good heart health. Please be sure to contact your doctor if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or swelling in your legs.
